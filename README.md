    1. Performance - It must be fast and easy to use (user friendly interface).
    1. Authentication - The user login must be authorised and validated by the system while returning the book.
    2. Scalability - The system will be utilised by a sizable number of both research scholars and employees, so it must be modified to manage such a large number of users.
    3. Reliability - Database must be kept up to date so that it does not shows a book available while it is being issued by someone.
    4. Maintainability - It must be easy to maintain and make new changes without affecting the current system.

## 2. Identify scope, features and non-functional aspects of the following problem.

### 1. Scope
    - The challenge's goal is to develop a smartphone application that uses artificial intelligence to find noteworthy sound occurrences that are relevant to this group and serves to their daily needs. The persons who are partially deaf can greatly be benefitted from this application.
    
### 2. Features
    - Notify friends and relatives if a critical emergency is identified and the user doesn't respond.
    - Alerts to user about the incoming sounds.
    - The app should alert the users when it recognizes the sounds of critical situations.
    - The app should run in the background also.

### 3. Non-Functional aspects
    - It must work fast and ensure that there is no delay in recognition.
    - It must identify sounds correctly with accuracy.
    - The app should alert the user through some vibrations.
    - App should send the current position to friends and relatives in case of an emergency via the app accurately.
